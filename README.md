This code corresponds to the publication "Solvent Selection for Polymers Enabled by Generalized
Chemical Fingerprinting and Machine Learning". The repository contains data to
assist in the visualization of certain plots in the paper.

## Requirements
Requirements are managed by [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), not the
requirements.txt file. That is just for [binder's build process](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/binder/zero-to-binder.html).
To generate an updated requirements.txt file, run `poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt --without-hashes`
